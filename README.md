* weeddao is just a temp name
* This is a platform that can be used to find safe spaces for poc/woc to smoke up

You must have the flutter sdk installed if you are testing this from source.Flutter allows you to write code once and deploy to multiple devices, it is hardware Agnostic. More about flutter here: <https://flutter.dev/>

 This app runs firebase for datastorage and login. I've managed to map the user login to the shopping cart, which means cart items are personal to each user. Admittedly this was a very difficult task to figure out.

 I can write solidity smart contracts and know how to use the blockchain. However I decided against adding any of that related functionality at this time!

# A few notes about the files

I am teaching myself GetX and was trying to experiment with various solutions to getting the cart functionality and user login with Google correct. I sectioned off non-used files into seperate folders. These are the folders with non-used files:
<br>
<li> <b> lib/Models/components</b></li>
<li> <b> lib/controllers/Services</b></li>
 </div>

## As for my personal setup

* I run on a mac M1, iPhone XS Max and xcode simulator.

* VSCode is my IDE of choice.

* I don't own an android and have not tested my project on Android simulator. However this project is Android compatible. I have set it up to work on Android with my signing keys just in case. If needed I will send an APK file over!
